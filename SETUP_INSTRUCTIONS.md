# 🚀 Setup Instructions

## Push to GitHub

Your secure email agent is ready! Here's how to save it to GitHub:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create Repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
   - Name: `secure-email-agent`
   - Description: `🔐 AI-powered email processing agent with end-to-end encryption`
   - Keep it public or make it private (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have files)
3. **Connect your local repo**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/secure-email-agent.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Install GitHub CLI (if you prefer command line)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (macOS)
brew install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create and push repository
gh repo create secure-email-agent --public --description "🔐 AI-powered email processing agent with end-to-end encryption" --source=. --push
```
